--- Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports ---
--- Part One ---

"A report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:

The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.

Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.

How many reports are safe?"

LEO's NOTES: Streamed this again...
https://youtu.be/ihzF0jmiBf4?si=zDG8u1yjuTgJAnAb

Nothing much to say here. Read the input into a list of
newline separated strings, then turn each line into a list of
integers (PARSE-REPORTS). Then, check items in the list to see if 1:
all integers are either increasing or decreasing and 2: the difference
between any successive ints is between 1 and 3. I'll create a
predicate function, SAFE-REPORT?, to do the test.

My original SAFE-REPORT worked but was a little convoluted. I
converted it to a simple AND statement with inspiration from ynadji on
reddit. https://www.reddit.com/user/ynadji/ (I had forgotten that I
could use (apply #'> list) to test for an always ascending list!)

The final function will test each report and return the number of safe
reports.

(defparameter *example*
  '("7 6 4 2 1"
    "1 2 7 8 9"
    "9 7 6 2 1"
    "1 3 2 4 5"
    "8 6 4 4 1"
    "1 3 6 7 9"))

(defun parse-reports (los)
  "reads a list of strings, each containing a set of number strings,
 and returns a list of integer lists"
  (let ((reports '())) ; start with an empty list
    (dolist (str los) ; for every string in the provided list of string
      (push
       (mapcar #'parse-integer (re:split "\\s+" str)) ; split then convert
       reports)) ; add integer list to reports
    (reverse reports))) ; return the populated list (after reversing)

(defun safe-report? (lon)
  "returns true if the list of numbers is either increasing or decreasing
and always between one and three numbers apart"
  (and (or (apply #'> lon)                        ; always ascending
           (apply #'< lon))                       ; always descending

       (every (lambda (x) (< 0 x 4))              ; differences always in range?
              (iter (for (a b) on lon by #'cdr)   ; step through each pair
                (when b                           ; ignore nil at end
                  (collecting (abs (- a b)))))))) ; list all the differences

--- Part Two ---

"Now, the same rules apply as before, except if removing a single level
from an unsafe report would make it safe, the report instead counts as
safe."

LEO's NOTES: I can still use the parsing function from part 1 but I'll
have to write a new predicate function, RELAXED-SAFE-REPORT?, to
accomodate the new rule. And, as it turns out, I'll want a function
that can remove a single item from a list by its index into the list,
REMOVE-ITEM index list. The rest is a piece of cake.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |#

(defun remove-item (index list)
  "returns a list with the item at index removed"
  (append (subseq list 0 index) (subseq list (1+ index))))

  (5a:is (equalp '(0 0 2 3 4) (remove-item 2 '(0 0 1 2 3 4))))
  (5a:is (equalp '(0 0 1 3 4) (remove-item 3 '(0 0 1 2 3 4))))
  (5a:is (equalp '(0 0 1 2 4) (remove-item 4 '(0 0 1 2 3 4))))
  (5a:is (equalp '(0 0 1 2 3) (remove-item 5 '(0 0 1 2 3 4)))))

(defun relaxed-safe-report? (rpt)
  (when (safe-report? rpt)
    (return-from relaxed-safe-report? t))    ; naturally safe - return t

  (iter (for i below (length rpt))           ; how about if we remove one digit?
    (when (safe-report? (remove-item i rpt))
      (return-from relaxed-safe-report? t)))

  nil)                                       ; never safe

(5a:test relaxed-safe-report?-t
